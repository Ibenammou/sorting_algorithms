# Project 0x1B - C Sorting Algorithms & Big O

## Description

This project involves implementing and understanding various sorting algorithms in the C programming language. The goal is to work in teams of two to explore different sorting algorithms, learn about Big O notation, and gain insights into time complexity evaluation.

## Team Members
- **Project By:** Alexandre Gautier
- **Team:** Imane Benammou

## Background Context

This project focuses on pair programming for the mandatory part. Students are required to implement at least four different sorting algorithms, understand the concept of Big O notation, evaluate time complexity, and select the best sorting algorithm for a given input. Additionally, students are expected to comprehend stable sorting algorithms.

## Resources

Read or watch the following to enhance your understanding:
- Sorting algorithms
- Big O notation
- Sorting algorithms animations
- 15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes (Note: This video may trigger seizures/epilepsy)
- CS50 Algorithms explanation by David Malan
- All about sorting algorithms

## Learning Objectives

- Implement at least four different sorting algorithms
- Understand Big O notation and evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
- Select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
- Comprehend what makes a sorting algorithm stable
